This is almost never true. Even mothers who do not have enough to eat can generally make enough milk for their babies.     The amount of milk your breasts make (your milk supply) depends on how much the baby suckles. The more the baby suckles, the more milk you will make. If you skip a feeding and give a bottle instead of breast milk, your body will make less milk.     Some days it may seem like the baby is always wanting to breastfeed. If you feed your baby whenever it is hungry, your milk supply will increase. In a few days the baby will probably seem satisfied again. Night feeding helps to build up a mother’s milk supply. Try not to believe anyone - even a health worker - who says that you do not have enough milk.     Breasts do not have to feel full to make milk. The more babies a woman has breastfed, the less full her breasts will feel. Small breasts can make as much milk as large breasts.     A baby is getting enough milk if:      it is growing well, and seems happy and healthy.  it wets 6 or more times and dirties the diaper (nappy) about 1 to 3 times in a day and night.

This can make it hard for a mother to give her baby nothing but breast milk during the first 6 months. But your baby could get sick without your milk. A working mother should not have to choose between her work and her child’s health.     This is why working mothers need help. Some jobs allow a mother to bring her baby for a few months. This makes breastfeeding the easiest. If a mother has child care nearby, she might be able to breastfeed during the day, on her breaks. Some employers organize child-care centers so that parents can have their children close by.     Here are some ways to make sure your baby gets only breast milk while you are at work:      Keep your baby nearby for 6 months.  Or have someone bring the baby to you at feeding time.  When you are with your baby, feed it only from your breasts. If you sleep with the baby at night, it may feed more, and this will help you to make enough milk.  Some women ask a friend or a relative, like the baby's grandmother, to breastfeed their baby. If you want another woman to breastfeed your baby, she should be tested for HIV and have no risk of becoming infected while breastfeeding.  Another way a woman can give her baby breast milk during the day is if she can have time at work to remove the milk from her breasts. Then someone else can feed the baby for her.

If it is treated early it is often curable, but if left too long it can cause death. Many people who get cancer die from it, especially those with little access to health care.     All living things, like the human body, are made up of tiny cells that are too small to see without a microscope. Sometimes these cells change and grow in an abnormal way, causing growths (tumors). Some growths go away without treatment. But some growths get larger or spread and may cause health problems. Most growths do not become cancer, but some do.     Cancer starts when some cells begin to grow out of control and take over parts of the body.

Soaking your tools in bleach solution first will help protect you from infection when cleaning the tools. If you do not have bleach, soak your tools in water.     2. Washing:    Wash all tools with soapy water and a brush until each one looks very clean, and rinse them with clean water. Be careful not to cut yourself on sharp edges or points. If possible, use heavy gloves, or any gloves you may have.     3. Disinfecting:    Steam or boil the tools for 20 minutes (as long as it takes to cook rice).      To steam them, you need a pot with a lid. The water does not need to cover the tools, but use enough water to keep steam coming out the sides of the lid for 20 minutes.  To boil them, you do not need to fill the whole pot with water. But you should make sure water covers everything in the pot the entire time. If possible, put a lid on the pot.

Avoid contaminated air, food, or water caused by dangerous pesticides or toxic chemicals used in factories and farms: Pesticides and other harmful chemicals can hurt a man's sperm while he works and if the woman washes his clothes, the harmful chemicals are passed on to her.     Avoid smoking or chewing tobacco, or drinking alcohol or coffee:    Women who smoke or chew tobacco, or who drink a lot of alcohol or coffee may take longer to become pregnant or have more miscarriages. Men who smoke or drink a lot of alcohol or coffee make fewer sperm, and these are often damaged or weak.     Avoid high temperatures:    A man’s sperm need to stay cool. That is why the testicles hang in the scrotum outside a man’s body. When the testicles get too warm they can stop making healthy sperm. For example, this can happen if a man wears tight clothes that press his testicles up inside his body, or if he takes a hot bath, or works near hot things such as boilers, furnaces, or the hot engine of a long-distance truck -  especially if he drives for many hours without a break. Once the testicles become cool, they start making healthy sperm again.     Do not use any medicines:     Some medicines can hurt fertility. The best choice is for you and your partner not to use any medicines while you are trying to become pregnant. If you must use medicines because of illness, talk to a health worker and tell her you are trying to get pregnant.     Try to have sex during your fertile time:    Although a man makes millions of sperm every day, a healthy woman releases only one egg a month. This is called her fertile time - the only time during the month when she can get pregnant. For most women their fertile time starts about 10 days after the first day of the monthly bleeding and lasts about 6 days. The body has several signs that tell you when you are in a fertile time. The easiest signs to check are the changes in the mucus in your vagina.     When you have sex:   The best positions for getting the sperm close to the opening of your womb are:    to lie on your back with the man on top.  to lie on your side.  Then, after having sex, lie flat on your back for about 20 minutes. This will help the sperm swim into your womb and find the egg.     to lie on your back with the man on top.   to lie on your back with the man on top.  to lie on your side.

Do not use oils or creams during sex:  They can kill the sperm or stop it from reaching the egg.  Do not douche or wash inside your vagina: Douching before or after sex can change the wetness inside your vagina, making it harder for the sperm to live.  Treat any health problems:  Both you and your partner should have medical exams and be checked and treated for STIs, and other illnesses. If either of you has an STI, both of you must be treated. Be sure to finish all the medicines you are given.  Eat good, healthy food:  If you do not have regular monthly bleeding and you are very thin or very fat, try to gain or lose weight.  Avoid smoking or chewing tobacco, taking drugs or drinking alcohol.  Avoid caffeine in drinks like coffee, black tea, and cola drinks.  Get plenty of rest and regular exercise.

For example, the health worker may look at your partner’s sperm under a microscope to see if they are healthy. She may give you a pelvic exam to check your vagina, womb, and tubes for infection or growths. Or she may teach you to tell if your ovaries are releasing an egg by taking your temperature every morning.

Legal abortion in some cases: In some countries an abortion is only legal for certain reasons, such as:    if a woman becomes pregnant from rape or incest (sex with a close family member).  if a doctor says pregnancy would be a danger to a woman’s health.     if a woman becomes pregnant from rape or incest (sex with a close family member).   if a woman becomes pregnant from rape or incest (sex with a close family member).  if a doctor says pregnancy would be a danger to a woman’s health.  if a doctor says pregnancy would be a danger to a woman’s health.  But abortion is often difficult to get, even for those reasons. Doctors and health workers may not be sure what the law really says. They may be unwilling to do abortions openly, or they may charge a lot of money. Women may not know if abortion is legal or available in their country.   Legal or not, it can be hard to get a safe abortion because it is too costly, too far away, or because there are confusing rules, or papers to fill out.  These reasons often make it especially difficult for women who are poor, or who are not familiar with the medical system, to get safe abortions.  Unfortunately, in many places, the only women who can easily get a safe abortion are women who can afford to pay a private doctor.   Illegal abortion:  If abortion is not legal, both the women who get abortions and those who perform them can be arrested. In most places this does not happen. But where abortion is against the law, more women die from unsafe abortion and unsafe pregnancies. Money that could be spent on women’s health services is spent instead on treating complications of unsafe abortion.   IMPORTANT:  Never assume abortion is illegal. Try to find out about the laws in your own country. It may be easier to work around the laws than to try and change them. Even if abortion is illegal, there may be people providing safe abortions. Finding a safe abortion may mean the difference between staying alive and dying.       But abortion is often difficult to get, even for those reasons.

Including zinc (tablets or syrup) as part of the treatment for diarrhoea for 10–14 days helps to reduce its severity and duration, and also protects the child from future diarrhoea episodes for up to two months.

Point out to your husband and his family that without women no boy child can ever be born and therefore a girl child is always a blessing on society and necessary for the continuation of life in this world.     2. Explain to your husband that girls are pillars of the society. A girl can be a good daughter, a good sister, a good wife and, in the future, a good mother. If the practice of abortion continues for the next few years, we surely will see a day without mothers and thus no life. Without daughters, we have no future.     3. Tell your husband that girls are usually more obedient than boys. In general, girls show more responsibility, devotion and respect for their family, job, society or country than boys, and often they care a lot more about their parents than boys do.      4. If your husband and his family are still not convinced and blame you for \"only having girls\" ensure that they are aware of the following scientifically proven facts (which any doctor or health worker will confirm to be true, should your husband doubt it):       a baby‘s gender is determined at conception - and it is the male's sperm that dictates whether the baby will be a boy or a girl. We all get genetic material from both our parents, which is why children look like both their mother and father.   Prior to conception, the unfertilized egg of a woman only carries a genetic material called an X-chromosome. The male sperm, however, carries either an X-chromosome or a Y-chromosome as genetic material.   If a sperm carrying an X chromosome fertilises the egg the resulting embryo will be a girl, if a sperm carrying an Y chromosome fertilises the egg the resulting embryo will be a boy.  It is, therefore, the father‘s sperm that dictates the sex of a baby, not the mother‘s egg, so a woman is never responsible for the sex of her children.

To facilitate the conversation it may be helpful to share the following information with him:       Women under the age of 18 are more likely to die in childbirth because their bodies are not fully grown, and their babies have a greater chance of dying during their first year of life. So it is better not to have babies too soon.   Older women face more danger in childbearing, especially if they have other health problems or have had many children. So it is better not to have babies too late.   A woman’s body needs time to recover between pregnancies, so adequate spacing between pregnancies is safer for both women and their children.  So it is better not to have babies too closely after one another.   A woman with more than four children has a greater risk of death after childbirth from bleeding and other causes. So it is better not to have too many babies.  Having fewer children means less economic pressure on the family and will allow a husband to take better care of his family. So with fewer children a family can afford a better standard of living and better education for its children.

If you intend looking for employment or would like to start your own business having the support of your husband could be enormously helpful.     If you think your husband may be against your plans, try using the following strategies to gain his support:      1. Before talking to your husband think very carefully about your plans. If you do not know exactly what you want to do, and how you are going to do it, how can he be expected to understand your plans and to support you?      2. Take a firm, but non-confrontational, stand in discussions with him about what you want to do. It is important you discuss your ideas with your husband but you will almost certainly achieve more by staying calm and friendly than by yelling at him or by crying.      3. Execute your plans in consultation with your husband. If you ask for his help and advice he will almost certainly feel less insecure and suspicious about what you are doing and should recognise that you can both profit from the changes you are striving for.      4. Explain to your husband that his life will improve if he supports you because your family income will increase and you want to spend the money you earn on your family and home.     5. Point out to your husband that as the head of a wealthier family his status, and the prestige of your family in the community, will increase once you are earning money. Some men are afraid others will look down on them if they are no longer the sole wage earner of their family. Explain to him that this is rarely true and that, in most cases, the husbands of working wives enjoy even more respect.      6. Suggest to your husband that the incremental income from your work could allow you both, together, to provide a better education for all your children (boys and girls). Every father cares about the future of his children and recognises that in the modern world a good education is the key to success and a well-paid job. If your husband wants the best for his children he should not deny them this opportunity.      7. Demonstrate - using as examples women who have gone out to work or who have successfully started businesses in the same way you want to - how their families have benefited.       8. If, after attempting all of the above, your husband is still reluctant to allow you to work, try to find other family members to help you resolve the conflict and to support you.

A female child should be given access and opportunities in every field equivalent to a male child because girls are as valuable as boys.      Girls are not less capable than boys in any field. On the contrary, in school and at university, girls usually outperform boys. If proof is needed just refer to any recent set of examination results.      People want educated daughters-in-law but are often reluctant to educate their own daughters. This is neither fair nor realistic.

Do not think you have to face all your problems on your own. Not sharing your problems with others will increase not only your stress level but could be bad for your health and could also negatively impact on the rest of your family, too. So share your feelings with a few people you trust. Even if your problems are not resolved right away, talking about them will reduce stress and tension.      2. Make an effort to get people around you (family members, friends, neighbours) to help with your problems. If help is not forthcoming, try asking again using different ways to explain the things that bother you. Whilst not everyone will understand or be supportive, sooner or later someone will recognise your needs and provide support. Sometimes men just do not recognise that a woman may need help because they are just not aware of all the work a woman has to do. So try to motivate your whole family to work as a team for the sake of your children.      3. Try to encourage your husband to spend time playing with and taking care of your children. Many men think that only women should take care of babies and young children, but this is wrong as studies have shown that babies and children whose fathers get involved in their upbringing and education develop much better than others and become more intelligent when they grow up. So, ask your husband if perhaps he could play with, sing to or talk to your baby at least once a day or ask him if he could perhaps bathe, massage, or settle the baby to sleep.      4. Share your problems with other women. Women often feel anxious and shy about discussing their problems with others because they think no one will understand them or that people will look down on them if they talk about their difficulties.  However, by not making an effort to meet or talk to other women, they potentially lose many opportunities to get, and give, support within their society. You could try forming a small group of women who can meet together from time to time to talk about their problems by inviting some of your friends, friends of friends, neighbours or women you work with to meet together. You will find out that many of them are facing exactly the same problems as you and can probably  find ways to support each other by, for instance, sharing tasks like cooking or taking care of children once or twice a week.", "duration": 0, "created_at": "2020-12-05T20:00:26.540Z", "updated_at": "2020-12-05T20:00:26.540Z", "active": true, "published": true, "language": 1}}, {"model": "audios.track", "pk": 145, "fields": {"title": "How can I deal with conflicts over sex?", "index": 5, "audio_url": "https://audiopedia.wiki/images/En-02-10-13.mp3", "transcript": " Sexual desire is a natural part of life, and a woman can feel as much sexual desire and pleasure as a man. Traditionally women are often taught that it is their duty as a wife to  submit to their husband's sexual demands and that 'good' women do not have sexual desires of their own. This is wrong and harmful teaching. It is both good, and natural, for women and men to want to share sexual pleasure with their partners. When each partner knows the kind of sexual talk and touching that the other likes, they can both enjoy sex more.     Talk to your partner about sex. This can be very hard if you have never done it before, but it is very important. If you do not, how can he know that you are not enjoying sex? Tell him what you like and what you do not like. Your partner may simply not realize that your body responds differently to sexual touch from the way his own body does. Teach him how to make you feel excited.      Sex often begins with kissing, touching, talking, or looking in a way that makes a person feel excited. It often takes longer for a woman to get excited or reach orgasm than a man. Therefore, ask your partner to take time and be patient while having sex with you.      It is possible for almost all women to have orgasms, but many women never have them or have them only once in a while. If she wants, a woman may be able to learn how to have an orgasm, either by touching herself or by letting her partner know what feels good. Touching oneself does not use up sexual desire, and can be a good way for a woman to learn about her body and what kinds of sexual touch feel best - and to show it to her partner.      The amount of desire a woman feels may change throughout her monthly cycle, or at certain times during her life. If you or your partner do not feel like having sex, try to forgive each other and to talk about it. Allow time for sex when you both want it, and try to do things that you both will find exciting.     Sex should never be painful. Pain during sex is usually a sign that something is wrong. A woman may feel pain with sex when:      her partner enters her too soon before she is relaxed or wet enough.  she feels guilt or shame or does not want to have sex.  she has an infection (you should see a health worker to check this).   she has had a genital cutting.      her partner enters her too soon before she is relaxed or wet enough.   her partner enters her too soon before she is relaxed or wet enough.  she feels guilt or shame or does not want to have sex.  she feels guilt or shame or does not want to have sex.  she has an infection (you should see a health worker to check this).   she has an infection (you should see a health worker to check this).   she has had a genital cutting.

Unfortunately, many families are still not aware of the law and of the recourse available to wives and their families in the event that a wedding dowry is demanded. Others think that filing a complaint with the authorities would lead to the damage of their social status. So the tradition often lives on, although it should not.      Disputes about dowry issues are still frequent and often when parents-in-law do not get a dowry that meets their satisfaction, they result in the maltreatment of the daughter-in-law and can even lead to the husband threatening his young wife with desertion if she does not bring a big enough dowry from her parents.      If you are being ill-treated by your husband‘s family because of a dowry conflict the following strategies may assist you to defend yourself:     1. Try to contact a women‘s organization in your region (if available) to ask for information and help.     2. If this is not possible, try to talk to someone in authority you trust (e.g. a health worker or a religious leader of your community) or to other women you know about their experiences with dowry conflicts. Some of them may be able to support or advise you as you are certainly not the only one with this type of problem.      3. Try to find supportive neighbours and relatives who are willing to assist and support you. In many cases, just a small group of people willing to intervene on your behalf will be sufficient to let the in-laws know that their behaviour will not be tolerated.      4. Talk to your parents, brothers and other family relatives because you have the same right to support and help as any of your brothers. It is their duty, if necessary, to take you back into the family home to save you from abuse and/or violence. By seeking their help you are not making yourself a burden nor an object of charity because your parents and relatives must give priority to saving your life and to helping you rebuild a new life. Tell them if necessary that if they are not willing to take you back and make you feel welcome in their home, they would be as guilty of your misuse and, in the worst case, of your murder as your in-laws.      5. You may also consider legal action if you live in a country where dowry is forbidden and punishable by law. However, you should think carefully before going to the police or to court because in many countries where dowry is still practised, the legal system, unfortunately, is often inefficient and venal and all your effort might be in vain. So choose your battle wisely and, if possible, contact a women‘s organization before taking any action as they may help you to evaluate your chances of success.

It is therefore always a good start gaining his support and sympathy in order to solve problems with your in-laws and the following strategies may help you do so:        When seeking help from your husband keep calm, do not yell or cry. Explain the things that bother you and make sure he understands what exactly is upsetting you. If at first he does not understand the issues, try again and again until he does.

If you do he will start to defend himself (which is a human reflex) and may no longer be willing to listen to your explanations. Be nice, not angry. Try not to see him as part of your problem but as part of the solution to your problem. As your husband, he is your natural ally, not your enemy (at least he should be) so do not put pressure on him, instead, ensure that he understands you are asking for his help.   A frequent issue for many couples is that the wife wants to leave his husband‘s parents‘ home and set up a nuclear family. Whilst this may be entirely understandable many men hesitate to agree. Should this be your problem, try to understand and respect your husband‘s loyalties towards his parents and do not question them. Instead, try to explain what exactly is bothering you about your current living situation and together look for possible changes that might satisfy you without challenging (too much) his loyalties towards his parents. Hopefully, it will be possible to make some adjustments to your living arrangements instead of moving out. If not, remind him - firmly but gently - that as your husband he now owes you some loyalty too.   Never think that by talking to your husband about your worries and problems you will create further conflict.

Arranged marriages are still common practice in many countries. The bride and groom  have little or no say in what happens and following the wedding young girls are often isolated from their own families. In many communities, a woman becomes the property of her husband, who, after the marriage, may believe that he has the right to use her body for his pleasure whenever he wants.      Under these circumstances, many women find it very difficult to love their husband and to enjoy sex with him. Instead, they may feel they are being pressured into having sex with someone they do not know very well or possibly do not even like. They may reject their husband, or keep finding excuses why they cannot have sex with him. When this happens the husbands may get angry and force them to have sex, which can lead to a “vicious circle“, of the women resenting and rejecting their husband even more.

Because the man’s semen stays in the bag, the sperm cannot enter the woman’s body.     Condoms offer a good protection from pregnancy. They are most effective when used with spermicide and water-based lubricant.      Condoms have no side effects.     Condoms are the best protection against STIs and HIV. They can be used alone or along with any other family planning method. Condoms can be bought at many pharmacies and markets, and are often available at health posts and through AIDS prevention programs.      The condom must be put on the man’s penis when it is hard, but before it touches the woman’s genitals. If he rubs his penis on the woman’s genitals or goes into her vagina, he can make the woman pregnant or can give her an STI, even if he does not spill his sperm (ejaculate).     If a condom breaks or comes off the penis, the woman should put spermicide in her vagina immediately. If possible, use emergency family planning.     Remember:      Use a condom every time you have sex.  A woman who is using another family planning method should also use condoms if she needs STI protection.  If possible, always use condoms made of latex. They give the best protection against HIV. Condoms made of sheepskin or lambskin may not protect against HIV.  Keep condoms in a cool, dry place away from sunlight. Condoms from old or torn packages are more likely to break.  Use a condom only once. A condom that has been used before is more likely to break.  Keep condoms within reach. You are less likely to use them if you have to stop what you are doing to look for them.  At first, many couples do not like to use condoms. But once they get used to it, they may even recognize benefits besides protecting against unwanted pregnancies and STIs. For example, condoms can help some men last longer before they come.  Be careful not to tear the condom as you open the package. Do not use a new condom if the package is torn or dried out, or if the condom is stiff or sticky. The condom will not work. Do not unroll the condom before putting it on.      Use a condom every time you have sex.   Use a condom every time you have sex.

The more different ways a woman tries to keep from being raped, the more likely she is to be able to avoid the rape, or to suffer fewer injuries and mental health problems from the rape afterward.     It is impossible to know ahead of time how a woman will react when someone is trying to rape her. Some women are filled with rage and feel strength they did not know they had. Others feel like they cannot move. If this should ever happen to you, know that you will do what you can.     Here are some ideas that may help you during a sexual assault:      Do not cry, plead, or give in. It usually does not help. In fact, women who try this often suffer more injuries than women who fight back.  Stay aware. Watch the rapist carefully. There may be times when he is not watching you, or when he loses his control.  Try different things. Kick, yell, bargain, trick him -  do whatever you can think of to make him realize you are not an easy victim. Try to make him realize that you are a person, not an object.  If you know the rapist, tell him how you feel. Do not let him believe that women like to be raped. Make him be aware of what he is doing to you.  If the rapist is a stranger, try to memorize what he looks like. How big is he? Does he have scars, marks, or tattoos? What kind of clothes is he wearing? Try to remember them so that you can tell the police and warn the other women in your community.  If there are several people trying to rape you, or if the rapist has a weapon, you can still resist, but it is usually better not to fight back physically.  Use your best judgement. Only you can decide how much to fight back. In some rape situations, for example, during war, the rapist may have no reason to keep you alive if you resist.     Do not cry, plead, or give in.

However, the truth remains that suicide is a problem, not a solution. Even if you think there is no solution to your problems right now, it does not mean this other solution does not exist and will not appear in the near future. It just means that you cannot see it right now and you have to hold on tight to the reins of life.      Think for a minute: Have you always felt like you do right now? The chances are; there were times in your life when you did not mind so much, times when things were not so bad, maybe things were good even. Doesn’t that mean that something in your life changed to make you feel so down? And if it was change that caused so much pain doesn’t it also mean that another change can take the pain away? So be patient, the day will come when things change for the better. Life is a cycle of joy and sorrow, after all.     IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE:     Do not blame yourself for feeling suicidal. Life’s burdens are just part of life. It’s not your fault.  Being suicidal doesn’t make you a bad person, or crazy, or weak, or flawed.   It does not even mean that you really want to die - it only means that you have more pain than you can cope with right now. If someone starts piling weights on your shoulders, you will eventually collapse if one added enough weights, no matter how much you want to remain standing. This is normal.

Some of the most common kinds of trauma are violence at home, rape, war, torture, and natural disasters. Other negative life events that can also cause trauma to a woman are the loss and/or death of someone or something important (for example: parental loss, death of husband or a child, loss of jobs or homes), chronic physical illness and development of a disability.

Depression or anxiety:    It does not always take a negative life event or trauma to plunge women into despair. The constant, high level of stress most women experience in their daily life can cause them either depression or anxiety, or even both.      Depression is a state of low mood or a feeling of aversion to activity that can affect a person’s behaviour, thoughts, feelings and well-being over a long period of time.

Other terms often used in relation with anxiety disorder are: ‘nerves’, ‘nervous attack’ and ‘mental distresses.

But a man chooses to use violence because it is a way he can get what he needs or what he feels is rightfully his as a man.     When a man does not feel that he has power over his own life, he may use violence to try and control another person’s life. It is natural for someone to want to control his or her own life in normal ways, but it is wrong to try and control someone else’s life, especially with violence.      Here are some of the reasons why some men hurt women:      Violence works  Violence works   It offers the man a quick end to a disagreement without having to talk about the real problem or find a real solution.   A man may find the fight exciting, and have lots of energy afterward. He may want to have these feelings again.   If a man uses violence, he ‘wins’ and gets his way. The victim is likely to give him his way again the next time to avoid being hurt. This gives the man even more power. Violent or abusive relationships often happen when one person has more power over the other.      The man has a wrong idea about what it means to be a man.  The man has a wrong idea about what it means to be a man.   If a man believes that to be a man, he must control what a woman does, he may feel it is OK to hurt her.

Violent or abusive relationships often happen when one person has more power over the other.      The man feels that the woman belongs to him, or that he needs her.  The man feels that the woman belongs to him, or that he needs her.   If the woman is ‘strong’, the man may feel afraid that he will lose her, or that she does not need him.

How to make the stove:  Use the can opener or tin snips to take the lid off the big can. Cut a 4-inch round hole in the middle of the lid for the chimney. Cut another 4-inch round hole in the lower front side of the can, about 1 inch up from the bottom of the can, for the burning chamber. The holes you cut should fit around your stove pipe or tin cans.  Place the stove pipe with the elbow inside the can so that one end sticks out of the front of the can. Make 2 parallel cuts ½ inch apart at the long end of the pipe and bend the section back to create a lip. This way the pipe will not slip back into the can. The long section of this pipe will be the burning chamber (where the fuel burns). Attach a straight section of pipe to the short end of the elbow to make a chimney that ends 1 inch below the top of the can. Make a lip on this pipe, too, so the top of the pipe will not fall into the can.  Note: A chimney made from tin cans will only last 1 to 3 months, and then you will need to replace it. To prevent this, try making a fired clay chimney with a mixture of 3 parts sand and 2 parts clay. Put this clay around the chimney of tin cans. When the cans burn through, you will have a clay chimney supported by all the insulation packed around it.   Fill the body of the stove, around the chimney, with insulation such as wood ash.  Replace the can lid over the insulation and around the chimney.  Use a tin can to make a shelf inside the burning chamber. Remove the ends of the can and flatten it. Then cut it into a T shape that will fit inside the pipe. The top of the T will stick out and keep the shelf from slipping inside. Place a brick or rock under the outside part of the shelf to support the twigs while they are burning.  Use your grating or fencing for resting the pot on the top of the stove.  Make a skirt with extra metal. It should surround the pot, leaving a ¼ inch gap between the skirt and the pot at its base. For an even better skirt, make a double skirt and put insulation between the 2 sheets of metal.  If you need to cook inside, place the stove near a wall with an opening in it. The smoke can climb along the wall and leave the building.     How to make the stove:     Use the can opener or tin snips to take the lid off the big can.
